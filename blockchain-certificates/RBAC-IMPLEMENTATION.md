## 🎯 Role Structure

```
SUPER_ADMIN_ROLE (Deployer + designated super admins)
├── Full system control
├── Manage all roles
├── Emergency pause/unpause
└── Override all permissions

ADMIN_ROLE
├── Issue certificates
├── Revoke certificates
├── Manage ISSUER, REVOKER, VERIFIER roles
└── Access admin dashboard

ISSUER_ROLE
└── Issue new certificates only

REVOKER_ROLE
└── Revoke existing certificates only

VERIFIER_ROLE
└── Read-only verification access
```

---

## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. **Deploy Contract**
```bash
cd blockchain-certificates
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

### 2. **Setup Roles**

Edit `config/roles.json`:
```json
{
  "superAdmins": ["0x..."],
  "admins": ["0x..."],
  "issuers": ["0x...", "0x..."],
  "revokers": ["0x..."],
  "verifiers": ["0x..."]
}
```

Run setup script:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/setupRoles.js --network localhost
```

### 3. **Start Frontend**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### 4. **Connect Wallet**
- Click "Connect MetaMask"
- Your roles will be automatically detected and displayed
- Role badges appear in the wallet info section

### 5. **Access Admin Dashboard**
- If you have ADMIN_ROLE or SUPER_ADMIN_ROLE
- Click the "🔐 Admin Dashboard" button
- Manage roles, users, and emergency controls

## 📊 Contract Functions

### Permission-Based Functions

| Function | SUPER_ADMIN | ADMIN | ISSUER | REVOKER | VERIFIER | Public |
|----------|-------------|-------|--------|---------|----------|--------|
| `mintCertificate` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `revokeCertificate` | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `grantRole` | ✅* | ✅* | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

- `hasRole(role, address)` - Check if address has specific role
- `getUserRoles(address)` - Get all roles for an address
- `isAdmin(address)` - Check if address is an admin
- `canIssue(address)` - Check if address can issue certificates
- `canRevoke(address)` - Check if address can revoke certificates
- `requestRole(role, justification)` - Request a role (emits event)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Contract not deployed
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

### Issue: Roles not assigned
```bash
# Edit config/roles.json first
npx hardhat run scripts/setupRoles.js --network localhost
```

### Issue: Admin dashboard not showing
- Ensure you have ADMIN_ROLE or SUPER_ADMIN_ROLE
- Check wallet is connected
- Verify contract address in frontend .env

### Issue: Cannot issue certificates
- Check you have ISSUER_ROLE, ADMIN_ROLE, or SUPER_ADMIN_ROLE
- Verify Pinata keys are configured
- Ensure contract is not paused
