# ✅ Network Detection Fixed!

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### Problem:
Scripts were showing `Network: undefined` even when deploying to Sepolia.

### Root Cause:
Hardhat 3.0 changed how `network.name` works. The old method `network.name` returns `undefined`.

### Solution:
Updated scripts to detect network from Chain ID:
- Chain ID `11155111` → Sepolia
- Chain ID `31337` → Localhost  
- Chain ID `1` → Mainnet
- And more...

---

## ✅ Files Fixed

### 1. `/scripts/deploy.js`
- ✅ Added network detection from Chain ID
- ✅ Now correctly shows "Sepolia Testnet"
- ✅ Saves deployment as `sepolia.json` (not `undefined.json`)

### 2. `/scripts/setupRoles.js`
- ✅ Added network detection from Chain ID
- ✅ Now correctly shows "sepolia"
- ✅ Looks for correct deployment file

### 3. `/deployments/sepolia.json`
- ✅ Created with correct contract address
- ✅ Points to verified contract: `0x21a52497CfA2184AF8Eac91374DB4f4865c0d0c4`

### 4. `/frontend/.env`
- ✅ Updated contract address to verified one
- ✅ Network configuration set to Sepolia
- ✅ All environment variables correct

## 🎯 Your Verified Contract

**Address:** `0x21a52497CfA2184AF8Eac91374DB4f4865c0d0c4`  
**Network:** Sepolia Testnet  
**Status:** ✅ Verified on Blockscout  
**Explorer:** https://eth-sepolia.blockscout.com/address/0x21a52497CfA2184AF8Eac91374DB4f4865c0d0c4#code

## 🧪 Test It Now

### 1. Deploy Script (shows network correctly):
```bash
npm run deploy:sepolia
```

**Expected Output:**
```
📡 Network: Sepolia Testnet (sepolia)
```

### 2. Setup Roles (shows network correctly):
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/setupRoles.js --network sepolia
```

**Expected Output:**
```
📡 Network: sepolia
📍 Contract Address: 0x21a52497CfA2184AF8Eac91374DB4f4865c0d0c4
```

### 3. Frontend (shows Sepolia):
```bash
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

**Then:**
1. Open http://localhost:3002
2. Connect MetaMask (on Sepolia)
3. Should show "Sepolia" network

## 📊 Network Detection Logic

```javascript
// Get Chain ID from provider
const network = await provider.getNetwork();
const chainId = Number(network.chainId);

// Map to network name
const chainIdToNetwork = {
  1: "mainnet",
  11155111: "sepolia",     // ← Your network!
  31337: "localhost",
  80001: "mumbai",
  137: "polygon"
};
```

## ✅ Verification

Everything now correctly identifies as **Sepolia**:

| Component | Network Display | Status |
|-----------|----------------|--------|
| Deploy Script | ✅ "Sepolia Testnet" | Fixed |
| Setup Roles | ✅ "sepolia" | Fixed |
| Deployment Files | ✅ `sepolia.json` | Fixed |
| Frontend | ✅ Sepolia config | Fixed |
| Contract Address | ✅ Verified contract | Updated |

---

## 🎉 All Fixed!

Your entire setup now correctly identifies and uses the Sepolia network:

- ✅ Scripts show correct network name
- ✅ Deployment files saved with correct name
- ✅ Frontend connected to verified contract
- ✅ Network detection works automatically

**No more "undefined" networks!** 🚀

---

## 💡 Why This Matters

1. **Correct Deployment Files** - Scripts can find the right contract
2. **Clear Logging** - You know exactly which network you're on
3. **No Confusion** - Everything clearly shows "Sepolia"
4. **Works Automatically** - Detects network from blockchain itself

---

**Test your scripts now and see "Sepolia" everywhere!** 🎯
