# Role-Based UI Display - Implementation Summary

## What Changed?

The frontend now shows different sections based on:
1. **Wallet Connection Status** - Before/after connecting wallet
2. **User Roles** - Only show features the user can access

## UI Behavior

### 🔓 Before Wallet Connection (Public View)

**What Users See:**
- ✅ Welcome banner with feature overview
- ✅ **Verify Certificate** section (fully functional, no wallet needed)
- ❌ Issue Certificate section (hidden)
- ❌ Revoke Certificate section (hidden)
- ❌ Statistics dashboard (hidden)
- ❌ Admin Dashboard button (hidden)

**Message Displayed:**
```
🎓 Welcome to Blockchain Certificate System

Verify certificates publicly or connect your wallet to access more features

✓ Public Verification
  Anyone can verify certificates - no wallet needed!

📝 Issue Certificates
  Connect wallet with ISSUER role to mint certificates

🚫 Revoke Access
  Connect wallet with REVOKER role to revoke certificates
```

### 🔒 After Wallet Connection

The UI dynamically shows sections based on user roles:

#### For Users **WITHOUT** Special Roles
- ✅ Verify Certificate section
- ❌ Issue Certificate section (hidden - no ISSUER_ROLE)

#### For Users **WITH ISSUER + REVOKER ROLES**
- ✅ Verify Certificate section
- ✅ **Issue Certificate section**
- ✅ **Revoke Certificate section**
- ✅ Statistics dashboard

#### For **ADMIN** or **SUPER_ADMIN**

## Implementation Details

### Conditional Rendering Logic

```jsx
// Statistics - Only for connected users
{stats && account && (
  <div className="stats-grid">
    {/* stats cards */}
  </div>
)}

// Issue Certificate - Only for users with ISSUER_ROLE or higher
{account && userPermissions?.canIssue && (
  <div className="card">
    <h2>📝 Issue New Certificate</h2>
    {/* form */}
  </div>
)}

// Verify Certificate - ALWAYS SHOWN (public access)
<div className="card">
  <h2>✓ Verify Certificate</h2>
  <p>ℹ️ No wallet connection required - Anyone can verify certificates!</p>
  {/* form */}
</div>

// Revoke Certificate - Only for users with REVOKER_ROLE or higher
{account && userPermissions?.canRevoke && (
  <div className="card">
    <h2>🚫 Revoke Certificate</h2>
    {/* form */}
  </div>
)}
```

### Permission Checking

The `userPermissions` object contains:
```javascript
{
  canIssue: boolean,     // Has ISSUER_ROLE, ADMIN_ROLE, or SUPER_ADMIN_ROLE
  canRevoke: boolean,    // Has REVOKER_ROLE, ADMIN_ROLE, or SUPER_ADMIN_ROLE
  isAdmin: boolean,      // Has ADMIN_ROLE or SUPER_ADMIN_ROLE
  roles: string[]        // Array of role names
}
```

## User Experience Flow

### Scenario 1: Public User (No Wallet)
1. Opens website
2. Sees welcome banner
3. Can immediately verify certificates
4. Sees "Connect MetaMask" button to access more features

### Scenario 2: Regular User (Wallet, No Roles)
1. Connects wallet
2. Welcome banner disappears
3. Only sees "Verify Certificate" section
4. No access to Issue/Revoke
5. Footer shows: `❌ Issue | ❌ Revoke | ❌ Admin`

### Scenario 3: Issuer
1. Connects wallet
2. Sees Issue Certificate form
3. Can mint new certificates
4. Cannot revoke certificates
5. Footer shows: `✅ Issue | ❌ Revoke | ❌ Admin`

### Scenario 4: Revoker
1. Connects wallet
2. Sees Revoke Certificate form
3. Can revoke certificates
4. Cannot issue certificates
5. Footer shows: `❌ Issue | ✅ Revoke | ❌ Admin`

### Scenario 5: Admin
1. Connects wallet
2. Sees ALL sections
3. Sees "Admin Dashboard" button
4. Full control over roles and permissions
5. Footer shows: `✅ Issue | ✅ Revoke | ✅ Admin`
